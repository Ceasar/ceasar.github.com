Some of my friends spent Spring Break partying in Bermuda. Others built schools in the third world. I spent mine in Skyrim.

Skyrim, for the unfamiliar is a game by Bethesda Studios, the makers of the previously critically acclaimed "Fallout 3". Similar to its predecessor, Skyrim features a huge, open world that the player can explore as he or she chooses (that is, gameplay is non-linear). Throughout the game, one encounters all sorts of towns, bandit camps, caves, and ruins where NPCs ask for helps, buy and sell goods, or outright try to kill the player.

What makes Skyrim particularly incredible is just how big it is, and just how much stuff there is to do. I spent at nearly a full week, 16 hours a day, exploring, and I wouldn't be surprised if I were told that I had explore maybe half of the game's content, if that.

This all basically culminates in the feeling that the world is somewhat real. While of course, as the Dragonborn, you are a hero chosen by fate, it's obvious this world kind of exists beyond just you. Besides the many dungeons, which are engineered to complete a loop so that the player doesn't have to do much back-tracking, Skyrim feels like a simulation in some respects.

To complete it, there is clearly a lot of effort put into constructing a plausible universe fit with its own lore. Throughout the game, the player frequently comes across books that can be read and NPCs who the player can talk with that explain the history of Skyrim and why things are the way they are.

All that said though, I feel like Skyrim really could have been a lot better. As immersive as it sounds, it very, very frequently breaks the fourth wall in a way that is highly dissappointing in retrospect.

Loading
=======

My biggest complaint has to be the frequent amount of loading that takes place. While much of Skyrim can be traversed without any loading at all, the game stops and load everytime the player enters a building or a city. Surely, there must be performance reasons or something to explain this, but I think it's such a huge hurt to the immersiveness that if Bethesda were to release again I would hope it should be the first thing to go.

Bugs
====

Second, there were a lot of bugs or oddities that I discovered while playing. The most frequent was the unrealistic physics that I encountered frequently when hitting a corpse with a fireball- while surely, I would expect some kind of knockback, when striking a corpse (which happened often enough in the heat of battle) the corpse acted as if it had no weight and would fly back at an incredibly fast speed, regardless of the weight of the body.

On one memorable occasion, I was at the recieving end of a giant's club which promptly killed my avatar, but contrary to intuition, rather than being smashed into the ground, I was sent sky-high.

Additionally, on a few occasions, I glitched through the floor and my character could traverse the world without any walls to block me as I was actually under the level. On yet other occassions, other characters would have their movement glitched, either impeding them from moving or causing them to teleport erractically around the room.

On other occasions, I would be speaking with an NPC during part of the storyline when an enemy would appear and, while I failed to ever let it progress to its natural conclusion, the sight of a troll beating its chest as it threatened to kill us both before charging was quite unwelcome.

Lastly, there were a few oddities in the behavior of various characters that, while last drastic than the other two, were often enough to remind me that it was just a game. Namely, my companion had a particularly hard time following me as I traversed difficult terrain via jumping up and down cliffs and swimming through bodies of water, and I was able to steal items that were placed in front of an NPC when standing out of sight directly behind them.

While infrequent, a bug, particularly ones that mess up the gameplay really can break the flow of the game.

Abstract Mechanics
==================

Ironically enough, RPGs are well-known for their abstract, non-sensical use of numbers to represent a character's ability or state. That is, a player may have 150 points of health, 200 points of mana, 100 points of stamina, 40 sneak, 30 blocking, etc, etc.

I think in general, the use of levels and stats is terribly counter-intuitive, hard to grasp, and contrary to the concept of role-playing. While surely, all attacks must do a certain amount of quantifiable damage, I think the number should be hidden from the player as is the case in many popular shooters. How then would a player sense he's becoming stronger? Of course, the progression would reveal itself when the player challenges foes he's challenged before and is able to defeat them quickly! This of course already does happen in many RPGs for this exact reason, so the use of numbers is almost entirely unjustified.

(Additionally, it often happens that RPGs, Skyrim being no exception, use these number to replace the sense of skill acquisition normally felt when a player actually acquires a skill.)

Somewhat unrelated, I also thought lockpicking was almost completely out of place (and not even fun). Smithing, enchanting, and alchemy too also were rather dull and nonsensical (particularly alchemy, which seemed to involve selecting random ingredients and combining them together in the hopes that a botion might be formed).

Unpredictable Difficulty
========================

Perhaps this had a fair bit to do with how I built my character (I played a battlemage character, with a focus on the magic, which often meant I hardly had enough health to survive more than just a few direct hits) but Skyrim often had a difficulty that was very hard to predict. While most of the game I could progress through with ease, knocking enemies out in short fashion from afar with my fireballs, occasionally I would end up in a situation where the enemies would simply trample me.

This is somewhat to be expected- the difficulty should rise and fall in order to be interesting, but the problem was that it often meant I had to restart, which breaks immersion. It often got to the point where the safest option for me was to save after each significant battle, which only made the immersion even worse.

UI
==

Finally, I'm brought to the subject of the UI, which I think could almost deserve a post on its own. While of course the game needs some way to indicate to the player how much strength he has, or what items he's carrying, or the ways he can interact with an NPC, Skyrim, and many other RPGs, fall into the nasty need to pause the game and pop up windows through which the player can interact. These windows, on every occasion, break the fourth wall.

This is a particularly hard problem in general, but its particularly hard with RPGs when the abstract mechanics mentioned are given such a high weight. (To give a sense of the vastness of the problem, by the time I decided to stop playing, I easily had hundreds of armor pieces and weapons from which to choose.) Of course, the choice would be narrowed rather dramatically if the designers focused on less choices and more interesting ones, but even then I imagine there may still be enought to cause some trouble.

Closing Thoughts
================

Overall, I enjoyed Skyrim. A lot of the things I mentioned here, while hindering the experience that should have been, were often made okay because they would switch the mode of fun from one of fantasy to either something comical or of making interesting decisions. And while I definitely invested far more hours than I should have, I'm quite sure Skyrim could very easily be one of the most influential games of this generation, so it won't have been all for naught.
