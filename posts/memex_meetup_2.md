# Memex Meetup 2019-10-05

On October 5, 2019, I attended a meet-up in San Francisco, the second of two
organized by Jeremy Nixon, where about ten of us presented memex projects that
we were building.  The demos were short, about 15 minutes each, enough to start
a conversation, but often not enough to get the full idea.

(A *memex* is a analog device that enables the user to creates connections
between documents.  [Vannevar
Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) coined the term in 1945 in
an article published in The Atlantic titled ["As We May
Think"](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/).)

The following notes are incomplete, filtered by what I thought was important,
and in many places will be incorrect, but I hope it provides value anyway to
those who were unable to attend.

Memory is a critical part of intelligence.

One way to improve a thing, is to decompose a thing into its parts, and then
improve its parts. What are the parts of intelligence? Some features include
processing speed and working memory.

Memory can be externalized. For example, by writing. Writing creates external
version of what was in your mind, and is more linear. By imposing structure,
you avoid loops/ruts/holes, and can make progress. Get all open loops into an
external system allows your mind to experience things in a way that is more
present

Externalizing memory enables you to gain knowledge of your own memory. You can
watch yourself learn and forget things.

Jeremy uses Google Docs to externalize his memory. This for several reasons: 1)
he loves spreadsheets and docs, 2) links between things are easy, 3) it's easy
to share. However, he wants to move off of it for privacy reasons.

Jeremy's system is private, but shareable.

His exo-brain has many pieces, but we focused on two: documents on
systematizing creativity, and documents describing models of systems.

## Systematizing creativity

Jeremy is interested in systematizing creativity. To practice this, he writes a
list of 10 items in 10 minutes in response to a prompt every day. Some examples
of the prompts included:

- "Ways to introduce one person to another"
- "How to be ahead of your time"
- "Projects worth doing" such as "Matching people in a city"
- "Truly disgusting concepts", a list of concepts that were overloaded or had
  too many, such as "ego", "consciousness", "energy", "meaning", "art",
  "beauty", "truth", "values", "power", "patriarchy" "free will")

If he ever runs out of prompts, his task for the day is to generate 10 new
prompts to use in the future. All of the prompts are stored in a meta list of
idea lists, which links to each idea list.

Why is this important? The ability to generate ideas defines the spaces of
ideas that people have access to.

According to Jeremy, this practice has enabled him to generate plans and
concrete options in the face of a problem.

## Modeled systems

Part of intelligence involves acquiring many models. Jeremy collects models of
models. Some examples:

- A list of different ways to learn about something
- How to execute/get stuff done, a compilation of tools advocated by different
  books on productivity
- A document on how to build a machine learning model, which he came up when he
  was more active on Kaggle
- A meta document on how to create systems

The practice helps him see ideas that are similar across different domains.

## Quantified Self

In the past, Jeremy had a deep interest in the Quantified Self. He continues to
do time-tracking out of habit using a Google Calendar integration he built
himself and RescueTime.

A dream of the Quantified Self idea is that if you had enough data, you could
predict when you would be productive. However, the quality of data today is not
good enough.

## Other ideas we didn't get to talk about

- How to take advantage of crowd-sourcing
- How to make Twitter build on itself
- Has post on his website which is is insightful

R&D at at Khan Academy and worked at Apple.*

Andy introduced himself with a series of questions:

- Where do ideas come from?
- Why is thinking so hard?
- Why do knowledge workers seem to be so bad relative to other workers?
- How do we make actions accumulate?
- Why is it that there has been so little progress on tools for thoughts in the
  last 30 years?
- Why are his capable colleagues are incapable of producing anything important
  here?
- Does he know anything that they don't that might allow progress to be made?

He calibrated himself by asking us how many of us were familiar with the
following questions:

- How many of us were familiar with spaced repetition? How many do it regularly?
- How many many of us were familiar with a Zettelkasten?
- How many of us were technologists?

He had just published an essay, or perhaps more accurately a mini-book, called
["How can we develop transformative tools for
thoughts?](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) with Michael Nielson.

## "We have a deadly temptation as technologists to build stuff."

Andy argued there was a deficit in thinking about the space of tools for
thought, which has results in many products by the tech industry which have not
made significant innovations.

Andy made a limit claim that standard designs methods were insufficient for
making significant advances. To help explain, Andy described how Roman numerals
had many issues such as a difficulty with multiplying and an unscalable system
for representing large numbers, and then asked us, "What if you were IDEO in
the Roman Empire?" (For those unfamiliar, IDEO are basically pioneers of the
design methods which are most commonly practiced today.) If IDEO had been
around and tasked with helping the royal accountant, they likely would have
done many things:

- Consult experts in math
- Embed themselves in a math department
- Do brainstorm sessions with experts
- Build prototypes

But despite all this, it's unlikely that IDEO would have invented Arabic
numerals because to do so requires mathematical insight that requires a deep
knowledge of distributivity and associativity that only mathematicians would
have had. In general, these are limits to what IDEO is capable of improving
because some domains require expert insight. Tools for thoughts seem to be one
of these domains, and therefore before building more, our first project should
be to think hard about how our current tools are insufficient.

I don't recall the context, but we discussed how there existed decks of cards
for generating ideas and how it may have helped the Romans come up with a
system that could at least handle large numbers, but which might not have been
easy to multiply in. Some examples of these decks of cards include:

- The Art of Game Design by Jesse Schell
- IDEO has design method deck of cards
- Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno. For example: "What if you try making the
  problem worse?"

Matuschak built a thing called ["Quantum
Country"](https://quantum.country/qcvc), which has been live since March, and
is evolving weekly.

Matuschak was interested in an idea he called "programmable attention" which he
explained but which I didn't fully understand. One example of this was
maintaining a "question buffer", where you repeatedly answer the same set of
questions, and then compare your answers over time.

Joel has been working on a memex for 20 years. He is mostly interested in
increasing his returns on cognitive effort.

## Anatomy of an exocortex

A tool that could aid with recall has the capacity to be very powerful. Niklas
Luhmann, who invented the Zettelkasten system, claimed it was a "collaborator
in his work".

Human memory has several issues:

- Working memory has only 5-10 slots (which is made worse that it gets affected
  by day-to-day stuff as what's for lunch). Even if you worked on millions of
  problems, they may not 

- Our brains can commit things to long-term memory, but has evolved to focus on
  things that are socially useful

Intelligence augmentation is about increasing returns on cognitive work.

### Solutions

Joel created for himself a variation of a Zettelkasten where cards can be
arranged into articles, where an article is just a sequence of cards.

Each card is written as a re-usable thought chunk with a unique number in the
corner to identify it.  Joel emphasized cards should be written in a format
where a third-party could see and know what you're talking about without the
context you have, so that it will make sense to yourself years later. In other
words, cards should probably be paragraphs instead of words or phrases.

The advantage of this system is that if you improve a card, you improve every
article it appears in. The disadvantage of the system is that you need to check
every article it appears in to see if it still makes sense. This issue is
called "drift", and was also an issue with Project Xanadu, which also enabled
transclusion. Joel argued that drift was a feature of the system, because it
forced you to write cards in a way that each could stand on their own. However,
in a sufficiently large system it may take too much time.

Joel observed that some cards were "super connectors". The times that each card
was transcluded followed a log distribution.

Joel explained to us how different memex system fail as they grow:

- At year 6, built-in search will fail (because it's word/phrase based)
- At year 9, indexes will fail because it will take more times to build indices
  than to write content

Joel began using "Pads" to organize notes on transient information. This was
based on a whitepaper called, "Dynamics on expanding spaces: modeling the
emergence of novelties". High-value information is transferred over to cards.

Joel think it might make more sense to think of a memex not as a single tool
but as a set of tools ("full stack intelligence augmentation"). He himself uses
a combination of Anki, cards, and pads.

His system is not public.

Conor is working on a company for his tool which is called [Roam
Research](https://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/1471). His system is similar
to WorkFlowy, but it has some interesting features:

- Bi-directional links between bullets
- Reusable bullets
- A slash command, that enables macros such as getting the current time, or
  showing a date picker to help you pick a date
- Different views of the data, including a Kanban Board and table views
- Inline version control

The core idea of Roam is that "You shouldn't have to know the structure of your
thought as you're typing".

# Mark Carranza

*Mark is a software engineer. He works at the Internet Archive and studies
semiotics at UC Berkeley with Terry Deacon. He's interested in the origin of
meaning as a scientific discipline.*

Mark has been working on his memex, called "mx", since 1984. His memex is the
simplest of all of them. It's a DOS program from the 80s that allows him to
create associations between two strings. He simply selects a string in his
database, and then he add type in additional strings and the program will
create associations and render them as a list.

It has 2.2M unique text strings with 7M associations between them. He can do
counts on the number of times each string was accessed.

Mark takes an approach from semiotics: the meaning of strings comes from their
relation or non-relation to other strings. I think he sees his project partly
as a work of art.

When Mark associates string, he doesn't necessarily understand what each string
means. For example, he doesn't understand what "Kant's transcendental critique"
means. But if he links it to enough words/phrases to it over time, it will
become more clear to him. As he reads books or papers, he continuously adds
phrases that are interesting to him.

I presented by my encyclopedia, [memex.cc](http://memex.cc/), which I've been
working on for the last six years. I explained that the software was less
interesting to me than knowledge of how to write decent entries, which involved
coming up with a list of common section headers. Each section header implicitly
is an answer to a question. If you can find patterns, it should become easier
to know the questions you need to ask when you encounter something new.

# Jacob Cole

*Jacob is an engineer, researcher, and now entrepreneur. His advisor at MIT was Tim Berners-Lee.*

Jacob introduced himself by sharing that he accidentally created his own
Zettelkasten, and that he was Frustrated that human activity is less coherent
than it could be because our collaboration tools suck.

Jacob is working on a project called IdeaFlow. He gave us a demo specifically
of IdeaPad Graph, and we tried to brainstorm in real-time a way to measure
memory. As we brainstormed, Jacob connected our ideas to ideas he had already
written down that were being autocompleted by the system.

The autocomplete uses semantic search. It's based on something called
"ConceptNet" but is more fuzzy. Jacob didn't fully understand because he hired
an NLP Phd to help him with it.

IdeaFlow is similar to Workflowy, but it has a few cool ideas:

- You can view it as bulleted lists or as a directed-graph (that uses
  force-projection to space everything out)
- You can link bullets together, and then see the linked bullet under the
  bullet its linked to

Jacob also shared some interesting etymologies with us:

- "education" comes from "educe" "to bring out that which is within"
- "instruction" refers to a process in Ancient Rome where they ran horses around
  a pole called a "curriculum"

# Collective ideas

Some questions/themes that came up that affected all of us:
      
- Is there a general interchange format for these systems?

  The answer is currently no. But as long as we are all using structured
  plaintext that preserves the semantic structure, it might be unimportant. We
  can always parse plain text.

- A common theme during the demos was that we should probably be using multiple
  tools, not just one, and tools sit at different layers.

  Joel has two layers for his system. Mark acknowledged his system solves only
  only one layer. Andy shared that Luhmann distinguished between epheremal
  notes and durable notes.

- A memex probably needs semantic search rather than text search. (Jeremy and
  Jacob both implemented semantic search. Joel said plain text search fails
  after 1 year of active use.)
