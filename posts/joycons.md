I love the innovation Nintendo is doing with the Joy-Con, but a [Reddit thread on how many Joy-Cons develop "drift"](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/cczxwz/i_know_its_been_said_a_billion_times_but_nintendo/), convinced me that I definitely didn't ever want a Joy-Con as a new controller. "Drift" is a condition where the analog stick feeds input to the controller even when the user is not touching the controller, which makes most games very difficult to play. This page compiles incomplete research on some Joy-Con alternatives and what the trade-offs are. Many of the alternatives are from a company called [8BitDo](http://www.8bitdo.com/), since it was widely recommended on Reddit.

Important terms that initially confused me:

- *Analog (thumb) stick*. Controller component that allows for directional input in any direction. Popularized by the N64 controller.
- *D-pad*. "Directional pad". Flat, cross-shaped controller input popularized by Nintendo. Unlike analog sticks, the input is digital; it can only register up, down, left, and right. (Joy-Cons have no D-pad, and instead have discrete buttons, so that they mirror each other.) Good D-pads are important when playing 2-D games such as platformers and fighting games.
- *HD Rumble*. Nintendo's proprietary advanced form of controller rumble used in "1, 2 Switch", locking picking in Skyrim, and others. See [Nintendo's Demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgvG227pLkY) which claims the user can feel individual ice cubes in a drinking glass. Read an [explanation of how it works mechanically compared to old rumble motors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/7gcwy5/hd_rumble_what_exactly_is_it_what_games_showcase/dqi5d8j/)
- *Amiibo scanning*. Can scan collectible figurines that yield in-game bonuses by holding them over the right Joy-Con when prompted.
- *Motion control*. Means the controllers supports gestures such as tilt, shake, or pointing. Motion control requires the device to have a gyroscope and accelerometer. *6-axis motion control* refers to Sony's patented motion controls for their Dual Shock controllers. The Nintendo Switch does not utilize 6-axis motion control, so this feature is unimportant.
- *8BitDo*. Hong Kong-based video game hardware company with a focus on retro-themed controllers. All of their controllers have a prominent D-pad, unlike most modern console controllers which place it in an awkward position. They sell a popular controller, the SN30 Pro, first unveiled at E3 2017, that is compatible with the Switch. (8BitDo uses abbreviations in their model names: "SN" stands for "Super Nintendo", "SF" stands for "Super Famicom", "G" stands for "Game Boy", "C" for "GameCube". "Pro" means it has analog sticks.) There are multiple variants of the SN30 Pro that you may encounter; they differ in style only. They also sell the N30 Pro 2, a smaller, cheaper, more portable, controller which is also compatible with the Switch. At E3 2018, 8BitDo unveiled a prototype SN30 Pro+ model, an improvement to the SN30 Pro, which will be released in August 2019.
- *USB-C*. Transmits power and data on a single cable. Widely used in Android devices. The Switch has a USB-C connector used for charging or connecting to the dock. Many controllers use USB-C for charging and for wired connectivity.
- *Battery*. Battery capacity is measured in milliamp hour ("mAh"). Higher ratings for the same battery type generally mean longer run times.

Hardware comparison (prices are at the time of this writing):

Name | Image | Price | Battery | Connectivity | Vibration | Motion controls | Styles | Technical issues
---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
[Joy-Con](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy-Con) | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Nintendo_Switch_Joy-Con_Controllers.png/254px-Nintendo_Switch_Joy-Con_Controllers.png) | [$70 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/32Hqeg7) | 525 mAh rechargeable Li-ion battery. 20 hour battery life. 3.5 hour charging time. | Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 | HD Rumble | Accelerometer, Gyroscope | Multiple colors | Analog stick may drift after several weeks of normal use with no way to repair. No D-pad.
[Nintendo Switch Pro Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_Pro_Controller) | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-FL.jpg/617px-Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-FL.jpg) | [$63 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0) | 1300 mAh rechargeable Li-ion battery. 40 hour battery life. 6 hour charging time via USB-C. | Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 | HD Rumble | Accelerometer, Gyroscope | Black, some limited edition styles | Mixed reviews from the Joycon drift Reddit thread. Many people like the ergonomics (it has grips) and many claim they have had no issues. However, multiple people reported that it suffers from drift like the Joy-Con. Others complain about the D-pad lacking a ball in the middle, which makes it easy to accidentally input a diagonal. People comfortable with modding have had success fixing the D-pad.
[8BitDo SN30 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-SN30-Controller-Windows-macOS-Android/dp/B0748S1VDC) | ![](http://support.8bitdo.com/images/support/products/sn30pro.png) | [$45 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Y5ffJZ) | 480 mAh rechargeable Li-ion battery. USB-C charging. 14 hour battery life. 1-2 hour charging time. | Wired USB connection or Wireless Bluetooth | Eccentric shaft gear motor | Yes | Super Nintendo ("SN"), Game Boy ("G-Classic"), and formerly Super Famicom ("SF") color schemes | Lacks grips and for some is less ergonomic, but smaller and lighter than the Switch Pro. Cannot wirelessly wake up the Switch. Issues with D-pad similar to the Pro. Some report issues of input latency and connectivity issues when many controllers were connected to the system (perhaps from Bluetooth interference?).
[8BitDo SN30 Pro+](http://www.8bitdo.com/sn30-pro-plus/) | ![](http://support.8bitdo.com/images/support/products/sn30pro+.gif) | [$50 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2YllTjo) | Rechargeable battery pack or AA batteries. 20 hour battery life. 4 hour charging time. | Wired or Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 | Regular rumble | Accelerometer, Gyroscope | Black, Game Boy, and Super Nintendo color schemes | Similar to the SN30 Pro, but customizable (via what 8BitDo calls "Ultimate Software") and has handles which may improve ergonomics. L2 and R2 are now analog triggers instead of buttons, but the analog capability may not actually be used in any Switch games.
[8BitDo N30 Pro 2](http://www.8bitdo.com/n30pro-2/) | ![](http://www.8bitdo.com/images/products/n30pro-2.gif) | [$40 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2YoulyI) | 480mAh rechargeable Li-ion battery. 18 hour battery life. 1-2 hour charging time via USB cable. | USB-C Wired or Wireless Bluetooth | Linear vibration motor | Yes | NES, N64, Gamecube, and Wii styles | Similar to SN30 Pro, but smaller, and intended to be more portable. Some complaints about the smaller analog sticks and the arrangement of the shoulder buttons (L1, L2, R1, R2), which are [side-by-side](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HBlyajg5L._AC_.jpg), rather than [one-behind-the-other](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TLnfNSq3L._AC_.jpg) like the SN30 Pro.
[8BitDo SN30 Pro USB Gamepad](http://www.8bitdo.com/sn30-pro-usb-gamepad/) | ![](http://www.8bitdo.com/images/products/sn30-pro-wired.png) | [$25 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2JNDwPy) | N/A | Wired USB | Regular rumble | No | Game Boy | Similar to SN30 Pro, but cheaper, wired, lacks motion controls, incompatible with Android and macOS, and firmware cannot be upgraded.
[Nintendo Wired GameCube Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube_controller) + adapter | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/GameCube_controller.png/309px-GameCube_controller.png) | <$50 for controller on Craigslist  + $15-20 for an adapter | N/A | Wired | Regular rumble | No | [3 solid colors, plus many special editions](https://tay.kinja.com/every-gamecube-controller-nintendo-ever-made-ever-1658747867) | Did not find any complaints.
[Nintendo WaveBird Wireless Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveBird_Wireless_Controller) + adapter | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Nintendo-GameCube-Wavebird-Silver.jpg/286px-Nintendo-GameCube-Wavebird-Silver.jpg) | <$50 for controller on Craigslist + $15-20 for an adapter | 2 AA batteries | Wireless | Regular rumble | No  | Grey / Platinum | Did not find any complaints.
[PlayStation Dualshock 4 (DS4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock) + adapter | ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/DualShock_4.jpg/271px-DualShock_4.jpg) | [$45 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2JQwFVI) + $20 for an adapter | 1000 mAh Li-ion battery | Wireless | Regular rumble | Accelerometer, Gyroscope | | Didn't look carefully at this. Probably only interesting if you come from a PlayStation background?

Other controllers are possible via adapters, but none seemed popular.

Takeaways:

- Both official Nintendo controllers have the most features and are the only ones capable of scanning Amiibos, but they also are the only ones with reports of analog stick drift, which basically makes them unusable. The best alternative depends a lot on the games you like to play.

- If motion control is unimportant to you and you are optimizing for price, your two options are the wired SN30 Pro ($25) or used GameCube controllers from friends/Craigslist/GameStop. (Nintendo has discontinued selling GameCube controllers. Also, beware there are many bad knockoffs online, which can be distinguished by the lack of the "Nintendo GameCube" print on the front.) Between these two, the GameCube controllers have less technical issues, but the wired SN30 Pro is smaller and more portable.

- 8BitDo's SN30 Pro controller is a cheaper, more portable, alternative to the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, but it lacks some of Nintendo's proprietary features such as HD Rumble and Amiibo scanning (which may not matter to you). There are also reports of some issues which connectivity that the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller might not have. However, if you are looking to buy a new 8BitDo controller, it is probably worth waiting for the SN30 Pro+, which ships August 7, 2019. The Pro+ is only $5 more than the Pro, but includes many new nice-to-have features.

- If you want something super portable at the cost of ergonomics, the N30 Pro 2 looks the most interesting. The N30 Pro 2 is fraction, perhaps 1/3, of the size of a standard GameCube controller.

- For people who care about good D-pads, I haven't found any recommendations. Both Nintendo controllers have serious issues, and the 8BitDo controllers, despite seeming to market themselves as really caring about retro gamers, somehow failed to make a good controller with a D-Pad people like. I'm curious to hear what people actually use, or if everyone just mods their controllers.

Other comments:

- 8BitDo controllers require installing firmware updates. Since I don't own one, I don't know how hard this is, but it's something to consider if you're not very technical. On the other hand, future firmware updates maybe enable compatibility with future consoles.

- [The SN30 Pro may only connect to the Switch via Bluetooh, even when connected via the USB cable](https://www.reddit.com/r/8bitdo/comments/b753j9/i_just_ordered_a_sn30_pro_for_my_switch_is_it/eucbgle/). I can't verify this though. Perhaps something to think about if you care about input latency.

- Up to eight wireless controllers can be connected to Switch. However, [each Joy-Con counts as a separate controller](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22424/~/controller-pairing-faq), so only a maximum of four people can play using Joy-Cons. Another possible reason not to buy Joy-Cons.

Curious what other controllers people recommend, and if I made any mistakes or omitted anything important that I really should consider.
