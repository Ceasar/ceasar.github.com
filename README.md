=================

This repository holds my website.

Intent
======

*   I don't really want a blog per-se. I do like writing though. I want a spot
    where I can do whatever I want.
*   I don't want to manage a blog with tags and categories and pages and posts.
    I just want to make stuff.
*   I also want full control over the css, and not be coerced to use prebuilt
    themes.
*   I want to use Vim or whatever text editor I choose to craft my posts.

Build
=====

*   Simply install everything in the requirements file with pip, then proceed
    to run `python build.py` to get started. `build` watches the template
    directory for changes and regenerates the site.
