Why You Should Have Routines for Everything
===========================================

As any respectable programmer knows, a routine is a series of actions that achieve some goal. They happen so commonly that we frequently wrap them in a function in order to make our programs easier to manage.

Likewise, in life, there is a bunch of stuff that regularly needs to be done. One must shower, take out the garbage, do the laundry, go to sleep, etc, etc.

In order to reduce the amount of time I spend on these necessary, but unproductive activities, I find it helpful to automate them subconsciously. That is, determine how often such activities need to occur, and reserve a block of time to do these activities.

For example, the biggest endeavor I've taken on recently was to set a hard bedtime for myself at 10pm. I wanted to do this because I like being up in the morning when nobody else is in order to get work done. (Frequently, I have a 4-hour block before some obligation appears.)

The result is that I can now plan things out around that time. If I know that no matter what I will be asleep between 10 and 6, and I have an assignment due two days from now, I know I should probably start working today because I have commited to sleeping at those times above all else.

So what should my routine look like:
*   Wake up at 6am, turn on lights
*   Get shower / Clean face
*   Go running
